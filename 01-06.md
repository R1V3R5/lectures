# Preliminaries

1. Y'all kicked ass yesterday and I'm proud of you.

--

2. Saw ya'll splitting into groups and helping each other. Learning together.
   **THAT IS AWESOME AND PLEASE KEEP DOING IT**

--

3. Did anyone get stuck in the elevator? Stairs reminder.

--

4. If you didn't get the homework pushed, don't panic.

One time extension to 5pm since:

- I didn't demonstrate git stuff for more than 10 seconds.
- I wasn't terribly explicit about homework deadlines/rules.
- (NOTE TO SELF: This seems like a good place to talk about SO/Google).

---

## Let's Talk About Git / Github

- Demonstrate git things here.
- Ask me questions!

## Let's Talk About Homework

- What did you get stuck on?
- Did you learn any tricks?

---

# A Brief Aside on Hashes

## aka Hash Tables, Dictionaries, Maps, etc

- `{ key: 'value' }`

---

# Time for an Experiment!

### Ya'll have got me feeling bold.

--

### I can't give lectures like yesterday everyday.

--

### The prep work will bury me and ya'll will be exhausted.

--

### So I dug up some code of mine from 2008/2009.

--

### It's in Lisp ...

### Let's rewrite it and talk about it!

---

## (I am totes nervous)

### Project 1: Hangman (Late 2008)

Probably my first serious piece of lisp code. (i.e. over 100 lines)

- hangman.lisp

### Project 2: Cosmicomics (Early 2009)

A little more computationally intensive, maybe interesting.

- cosmicomics.hs
- cosmicomics.lisp

### Project 3 (maaaaybe): AT&T Call Logs (Late 2009)

Probably not but this was actually maybe useful?

- call-logs.lisp

---

## Homework

### Custom NATO Alphabet and/or ROT13 Encoder/Decoder

### TBD?
