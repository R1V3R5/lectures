# before the break

## ObjectSpace?
* how did I not know about this?
* each_object(Class), count_objects

## talk about various optional args
* old/new school keywords, hash args

## talk about classes have ancestors, superclass, <
*  (note that we can extend existing classes, say string)
*  instances don't. look at Hash in pry AND irb
*  talk about super
*  what about class methods / self.foo?

## talk about modules / mixins
*  can't instantiate, use with include, etc.

# after the break

## general dev tips
* cover `load` to reload? require "./" relative paths?
* cover `cd` in pry? cd .. / exit to go back

## roguelike example?
* oh god, oh god
