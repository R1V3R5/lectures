# Introductions

### Hey, ya'll!

### We're gonna spend plenty of time staring at code.

# Introductions

## Describe a memory of when you were first excited by computers or programming.

## How did you wind up at the Iron Yard?

---

# Preliminaries

- How do you Iron Yard?

--

- Ignore the hate/Ignore the hype. Programming is **not** about *tools*.

--

- You will spend half of your working life reading code, not writing it.

> Thus, programs must be written for people to read,
> and only incidentally for machines to execute.

Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, Preface

# Schedule and Expectations

- We are in a new space, try to be **gracious** as we find problems.

--

- I need roughly an hour of administrative time in the afternoon for interviews, lecture prep, etc.

--

- I will try to check in on Hipchat and IRC nights and weekends. They are logged.

--

- I learned Ruby (and Rails) on-the-fly, on-the-job. Tools change. Some of this (camping) I'm doing
  for the first time.

--

- If you're unclear on anything, ask. I'm new to teaching, give me feedback so I can do better.

--

- History and context is important. Certain things I just want you to know exist. I'll try to let
  you know what's nonessential / just for context. I'll do my best not to go off on tangents. :)

---

# Tools Discussion

## Let's talk a bit about our four main tools: Shell, Editor, Programming Language, Version Control.

- Editor / Programming Language.

--

- Shell. Where did it come from? Why use it?

--

- Version Control. Where did it come from? Why use it?

---

# Package Management

## A Brief Aside

- There is usually system-level package management. That's homebrew.
- There is also language-level package management. That's bundler.

---

# A Shell Checkup

### Commands:

- pwd
- cd
- ls
- cp, mv, rm
- cat / less
- mkdir / rmdir
- clear
- ssh / sudo
- man / woman
- grep

---

# A Shell Checkup

### Concepts:

- files vs directories
- absolute vs relative paths
- hidden files
- tilde / $HOME
- .. / -
- permissions (are a thing we'll get to)
- pipes
- redirection

---

# Start your rubies!

## Let's talk data types!

- Booleans

--

- Numbers

--

- Strings

--

- Symbols

--

- Arrays

---

# Variables and I/O

- Puts
- Gets
- Chomp

---

# A Brief Aside on Scoping

- Environments
- Bound vs Free variables

---

# Conditionals

### Basics: `if then else elsif end`
### One-legged: `when unless`

---

# Looping and Iteration

## Un-conditionally
- `for i in FOO`
- `times`
- `each`

## Conditionally
- `while`
- `until`

## Ranges!
- `upto`
- `downto`

---

# Methods

### def

### Substitution Model of Evaluation (with caveats)

### Expressions vs Statements

---

# String Interpolation

### `"here is some text and #{name}"`

---

# Today's Lab / Homework

### Go! Go! Go! [Happy Hacking!][homework]
