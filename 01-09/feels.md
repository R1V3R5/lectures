1. I'm proud of you because
   you're doing something hard.
   Mindset is **SO** important.
   Being unafraid.

   I'm proud of myself for taking this
   job. That was hard. Ignoring fear.

2. Talked a lot about lisp / haskell.
   Two points about that. Mostly for flavor.
   And to show there is a lot shared even by
   very different languages. Fundamentals!

  * All programming languages equivalent in power.
    * Not necessarily ease of getting things done (theory / practice)?
  * First two jobs got hired without knowing the language they used. Fundamentals!
  * A better design for the problem is better in any language. (rare exceptions)

3. If you start getting down on yourself this weekend, remember ...

* [computers can be trolls][computers]
* [you're gonna get it][problems]
* [take breaks][self-care]
